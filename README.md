# NexAI

> AI-Powered Personal & Developer Workspace with Utility-Metered Billing.

NexAI is a personal knowledge and developer productivity workspace designed with real, token-based credit metering, personal library management with semantic RAG retrieval, structured document drafting, variable-driven prompt templating, and an administrative usage dashboard.

## Tech Stack

- **Client:** React, Vite, SCSS Modules, Zustand, React Router, Lucide Icons, Axios.
- **Server:** Node.js, Express, Mongoose (MongoDB), Zod, Pino logging, Helmet, CORS.
- **AI / Retrieval:** Google Gemini API, Pinecone Vector Database.
- **Billing:** Razorpay (Test Mode).

## Prerequisites

- Node.js >= 20.0.0 (check with `node -v` or use `nvm use`)
- npm >= 10.0.0
- MongoDB instance (local or MongoDB Atlas connection string)

## Quick Start

1. **Install dependencies:**

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

2. **Configure environment:**
   - Copy `server/.env.example` to `server/.env` and configure `MONGODB_URI`, `JWT_ACCESS_SECRET`, `JWT_REFRESH_SECRET`, and `GEMINI_API_KEY`.
   - Copy `client/.env.example` to `client/.env`.

3. **Run development servers:**

   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```
   - Client: http://localhost:5173
   - Server: http://localhost:5000 (Health check: http://localhost:5000/api/health)

4. **Lint and format:**
